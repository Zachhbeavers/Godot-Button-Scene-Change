#           Open a script into your main node in the scene

#           In your Scene click on the button you wish to connect to another scene and then go to the "Node" window

#           Click on the "pressed" signal under the "Base Button" tab and hit "Connect" 

#           Connect it to the main script of the scene 

#           Delete the "pass" Then paste this line of code underneath the connected function you just put into the script
#           (It will need to be tabbed over) 



get_tree().change_scene()
  
  
  
 
#           So now your script should look something like this 
#           ("Button" should be whatever the name of your button is)



func _on_Button_pressed():
    get_tree().change_scene()
    
    
    
#           From there you should drag the file from the scene you wish to change too from the "FileSyustem" window
#           (It should be a .tscn file)

#           And drop the file into your script inbetween the two brakets after the "change_scene" function

#           Here is an example of what it should look like
#           (Yours will look slightly different from mine depending on file path)


func _on_Button_():
    get_tree().change_scene("res://scenes/Game_Window.tscn")
